<p><b>Ranking in Health Care</b> </br>
<small>with Katharina Huesmann, Christian Waibel and Daniel Wiesen, RR at <i>Management Science</i></small></br>
Effective motivation of physicians to enhance care quality is crucial in healthcare management. Peer feedback, based on quality indicators, is emerging as a favored non-financial approach, endorsed by professional bodies. This study investigates the impact of peer feedback ranking systems on physician effort, particularly how different ranking designs influence physicians with varied abilities. Despite the recognized importance of this strategy, there is a lack of systematic empirical evidence on how these rankings causally affect physician effort.
Our research, conducted through a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment involving physicians and medical students, replicates key aspects of clinical care and incentives. We explore how physicians' effort levels respond to various ranking designs, focusing on the relationship between these responses and individual abilities. Our findings suggest that a ranking system with thresholds spanning the entire outcome distribution maximizes overall effort. We observe that the placement of thresholds affects motivation differently: a high threshold at the top end of the distribution significantly motivates those capable of achieving top ranks, while thresholds in the middle and lower end help in not demotivating those who are not able to reach the top.
These insights can help guide clinical leaders. To optimally motivate their teams, leaders should consider setting rank thresholds that not only allow all physicians to improve their positions through increased effort, but also maintain a degree of exclusivity in rank attainment. This study contributes to the understanding of non-financial motivational strategies in healthcare and offers practical guidance for implementing effective peer feedback systems.</p>


<p><b>The Effect of Second Opinions on Health Outcomes – An Empirical Investigation</b> </br>
<small>with Razi Faruk, Felix Mindl, Eva-Maria Oess and Daniel Wiesen</small></br>
In most OECD countries, medical second opinion programs are widely introduced as a remedy to
inefficiencies in health care markets. Empirically, however, only little is known about the efficacy of
and selection into second opinion programs. Using second opinion and register panel data from one of
the largest health insurers in Germany, we present causal evidence on the efficacy of second opinions
on health care provision, costs, analgesic consumption and labor market participation. Particularly,
we discuss whether second opinions lead to overtreatment and undertreatment and determine whether
these effects are driven by increased compliance, i.e., outcomes if physicians agree or by correction, i.e., if
physicians disagree.</p>
