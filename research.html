<p><b>The Effect of Second Opinions on Health Outcomes – An Empirical Investigation</b> </br>
<small>with Razi Faruk, Felix Mindl and Daniel Wiesen</small></br>
In most OECD countries, medical second opinion programs are widely introduced as a remedy to
inefficiencies in health care markets. Empirically, however, only little is known about the efficacy of
and selection into second opinion programs. Using second opinion and register panel data from one of
the largest health insurers in Germany, we present causal evidence on the efficacy of second opinions
on health care provision, costs, analgesic consumption and labor market participation. Particularly,
we discuss whether second opinions lead to overtreatment and undertreatment and determine whether
these effects are driven by increased compliance, i.e., outcomes if physicians agree or by correction, i.e., if
physicians disagree.</p>

            <h3>Research Interest</h3>

<p> I am interested in credence goods markets, particularly health care, financial markets, and market design. I enjoy using both modern statistical and experimental methods. If you are interested to chat about your ideas in these fields, please feel free to <a href="../contact">reach out</a>.</p>
