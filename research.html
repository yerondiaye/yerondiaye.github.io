<p><b>Ranking in Health Care</b> </br>
<small>with Katharina Huesmann, Christian Waibel and Daniel Wiesen, RR at <i>Management Science</i></small></br>
Although relative performance feedback generally appears to be effective in improving performance in healthcare, there is limited understanding of how the design of rankings and individual abilities affect physician effort. Using a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment with practicing and future physicians ($N$$=$352), we systematically analyze effort choices under different rankings as a peer-feedback mechanism to improve performance in small teams. Ranking designs are exogenously varied by the number and position of thresholds in the outcome distribution. We observe that an additional threshold, which increases the number of ranks, leads to a higher effort only among individuals capable of exceeding that threshold. For the others, effort remains unaffected or even may even decrease. A ranking with thresholds spanning the entire outcome distribution maximizes overall physician effort. Individuals are affected in heterogeneous ways. Setting a threshold at the upper end of the outcome distribution significantly motivates individuals capable of achieving the highest rank. Thresholds in the middle and lower ranges prevent demotivating effects on those who cannot reach the highest rank. Our behavioral results suggest that in order to effectively motivate teams of physicians with peer feedback, clinical leaders should set thresholds such that all physicians can improve their rank through increased effort, while also preserving exclusivity for both the top and the bottom rank.

<p><b>The Effect of Second Opinions on Health Outcomes – An Empirical Investigation</b> </br>
<small>with Razi Faruk, Felix Mindl, Eva-Maria Oess and Daniel Wiesen</small></br>
In most OECD countries, medical second opinion programs are widely introduced as a remedy to
inefficiencies in health care markets. Empirically, however, only little is known about the efficacy of
and selection into second opinion programs. Using second opinion and register panel data from one of
the largest health insurers in Germany, we present causal evidence on the efficacy of second opinions
on health care provision, costs, analgesic consumption and labor market participation. Particularly,
we discuss whether second opinions lead to overtreatment and undertreatment and determine whether
these effects are driven by increased compliance, i.e., outcomes if physicians agree or by correction, i.e., if
physicians disagree.</p>

            <h3>Research Interest</h3>

<p> I am interested in credence goods markets, particularly health care markets, financial markets, and market design. I enjoy using both modern statistical and experimental methods.
