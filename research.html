<p><b>Ranking in Health Care</b> </br>
<small>with Katharina Huesmann, Christian Waibel and Daniel Wiesen, RR at <i>Management Science</i></small></br>
Peer feedback has strongly been advocated by medical professional societies as a key non-monetary strategy to improve the quality of care. Currently, if at all, clinical leader often provide feedback on key quality indicators in a rather pragmatic way. Systematic evidence on how to design peer feedback is scarce. We study how physicians' medical service provision is causally affected by peer feedback. Using a behavioral experiment, which mimics high-volume activity in a clinical setting, we systematically analyze how different non-anonymous ranking designs that vary in their granularity affect physician effort provision. In particular, we analyze how the heterogeneity in the physicians' abilities explains the responses to the different ranking designs. From a theoretical model of status concerns, we derive behavioral predictions. We report three main findings. First, peer feedback in form of rankings enhances physician performance on the aggregate compared to a non-ranking baseline. Overall, the effects tend to be stronger the more granular the ranking is. Second, the ranking design affects physician performance, and the impact of the ranking design depends on the physicians’ abilities. For an individual physician, increased granularity particularly motivates within her ability range - and may demotivate outside. Finally, our results indicate that small ranks at the tails of a ranking are salient. For clinical leaders, our results suggest that the use of rankings improves physician effort and imply that the choice of a ranking design should account for the composition of the physicians' abilities.

<p><b>The Effect of Second Opinions on Health Outcomes – An Empirical Investigation</b> </br>
<small>with Razi Faruk, Felix Mindl and Daniel Wiesen</small></br>
In most OECD countries, medical second opinion programs are widely introduced as a remedy to
inefficiencies in health care markets. Empirically, however, only little is known about the efficacy of
and selection into second opinion programs. Using second opinion and register panel data from one of
the largest health insurers in Germany, we present causal evidence on the efficacy of second opinions
on health care provision, costs, analgesic consumption and labor market participation. Particularly,
we discuss whether second opinions lead to overtreatment and undertreatment and determine whether
these effects are driven by increased compliance, i.e., outcomes if physicians agree or by correction, i.e., if
physicians disagree.</p>

            <h3>Research Interest</h3>

<p> I am interested in credence goods markets, particularly health care markets, financial markets, and market design. I enjoy using both modern statistical and experimental methods.
